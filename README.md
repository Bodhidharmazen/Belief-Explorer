# Belief Explorer

A multi-perspective critical thinking analysis system designed to help users examine and reflect on their beliefs.

## Overview

Belief Explorer is a sophisticated AI-powered critical thinking platform that helps users examine and reflect on their beliefs through multiple analytical perspectives. Unlike traditional fact-checking tools that simply classify claims as true or false, Belief Explorer employs a multi-dimensional assessment framework to analyze beliefs across empirical, logical, and pragmatic dimensions.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Arbiter Analysis System**: Three specialized "arbiters" examine claims from different perspectives:
  - Empirical Arbiter: Evaluates claims based on evidence, measurement, and observation
  - Logical Arbiter: Assesses logical structure, consistency, fallacies, and argument patterns
  - Pragmatic Arbiter: Examines practical utility, real-world implications, and functional value

- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Sophisticated analysis metrics including:
  - Verifact Score: Overall measure of claim verifiability
  - Model Diversity Quotient (MDQ): Measures agreement/disagreement between reasoning approaches
  - Contextual Sensitivity Index (CSI): Evaluates claim appropriateness within context
  - Reflective Index: Assesses awareness of assumptions and biases

- **Multiple Perspectives**: Generates diverse viewpoints on the same claim, highlighting how different reasoning approaches yield different conclusions

- **Responsive Design**: Clean, intuitive interface that works on desktop and mobile devices with dark/light mode support
