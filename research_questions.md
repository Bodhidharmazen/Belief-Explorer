# Belief Explorer: Research Questions

1. How can a multi-perspective analytical framework, integrating empirical, logical, and pragmatic evaluations, enhance the critical assessment of potentially misleading or false information compared to traditional fact-checking methods?

2. To what extent can an AI-driven system utilizing a multi-arbiter model effectively identify, analyze, and contextualize claims within user-provided text to aid in the mitigation of disinformation and misinformation?

3. What are the key metrics (e.g., Verifact Score, Model Diversity Quotient, Contextual Sensitivity Index, Reflective Index) that can quantitatively represent the nuanced assessment of a belief or claim beyond a simple true/false dichotomy, and how do these metrics correlate with human expert judgments?

4. How does presenting users with multiple analytical perspectives and explicitly calculated metrics on a given belief statement influence their critical thinking process, epistemic humility, and susceptibility to misinformation?

5. What are the design principles for an interactive user interface that effectively communicates complex, multi-dimensional belief analysis to non-expert users, fostering engagement and promoting deeper reflection on information quality?
